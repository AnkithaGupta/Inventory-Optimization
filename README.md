# Inventory-Optimization
Inventory optimization across different stores 
# Introduction
The retail industry has always been a dynamic and competitive field, with clothing retailers looking for ways to improve their performance. One of the biggest challenges is the low gross margins and excessive inventory going on clearance in some of their stores. We have analysed transaction-level data for two selected product classes (tops and dresses) in 10 different stores across the chain in 2019, with the goal of making recommendations to improve gross margin and reduce inventory sold at clearance.

We have utilized a three-step approach using Python. Starting with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data, followed by Clustering Analysis to identify patterns and segment the data. Finally, we used a supervised machine learning technique, Logistic Regression Model, to predict whether an item will go on clearance or not.
